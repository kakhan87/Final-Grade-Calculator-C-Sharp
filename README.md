# Final-Grade-Calculator-C-Sharp
The intent of this application is to provide a tool to instructors that they can use to calculate the final mark of a course as both a percentage and letter grade. When run, the application will display a window form with data entry fields for quiz marks, a midterm mark, and a final examination mark. The final grade is calculated using the weightings of 20% for the average of the quizzes, 30% for the midterm mark, and 50% for the final grade. The final grade percentage mark is converted to a letter grade using the same table included a later section of this document.
